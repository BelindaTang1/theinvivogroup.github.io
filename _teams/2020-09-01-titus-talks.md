# A podcast about redefining the rules in technology, careers, and life
We’re gonna talk about technology, with a special love for biotechnology, and we’re gonna talk about how technology is impacting our careers and our lives. Thrown in the mix, we’re gonna talk about all the great things people are doing with their lives and we’re gonna keep a focus on the people who make industries thrive and the world go around. Whether you’re an undergrad, new grad, grad student, CEO, or an everyday member of the community, you’ll love our talks and our guests. Everyone should join the conversation. Welcome to Titus Talks.
