# National Security Commission on Emerging Biotechnology
Congress charged the National Security Commission on Emerging Biotechnology with conducting a thorough review of how advancements in emerging biotechnology and related technologies will shape current and future activities of the Department of Defense.

The Commission is a legislative branch advisory entity and is expected to provide an interim report to the President and the Armed Services Committees in December 2023 and submit a final, unclassified report in December 2024, including recommendations for action by Congress and the federal government.

If you have ideas to share or would like to contribute to the work of the Commission, please email us at ideas@biotech.senate.gov or check out the website at [biotech.senate.gov/](https://www.biotech.senate.gov/).
